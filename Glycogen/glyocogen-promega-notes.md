We used the Qiagen Tissue Lyser II with 2-3 mm ceramic beads, on whole spat tissue with the PBS/HCL lysis buffer, for 50 Seconds @ 30 shakes/second. Notes indicate that we had more variable homogenization with larger tissues and we discussed doing longer homogenization in future, e.g. another 50 seconds. Not sure what homogenizer approach you will take but uniform homogenization of tissue is important based on discussions with Promega tech support. And again, we froze homogenates at least overnight before proceeding with the assay (defrosted and vortexed before starting assay).
 
Here are the notes detailing procedure from Megan:
 
﻿Made solution of 5mL PBS, 2.5mL HCI (.3N)
﻿﻿750uL of PBS/HCI solution added to lysis bead tubes.
﻿﻿Dissected oysters and weighed body – Shook a few times in tube to break up tissue
﻿﻿Place in tissue lyser – 50 seconds @ 30 shakes/second (freq)
﻿﻿Removed from lyser, added added 250ul TRIS Buffer to each tube (spun down for briefly to reduce foam height)
﻿﻿Placed in -20°C.
